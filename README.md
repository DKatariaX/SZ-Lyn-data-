# SZ-Lyn-data-
This repo contains all the data I used and created for the Timeseries photometry of SZ Lyn

I am a newbie at using github so apologies if it's not very nicely managed, I have no idea how to do any of the fancy bits here.
For all I know this place could be set to private and no one can even see this. 

That aside;

sourcelist.py = sourceAPT.py and APTBatch.py = batchAPT.py
