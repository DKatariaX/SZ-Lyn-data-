# SZ-Lyn-data-
This repo contains all the data I used and created for the Timeseries photometry of SZ Lyn

I am a newbie at using github so apologies if it's not very nicely managed, I have no idea how to do any of the fancy bits here.
For all I know this place could be set to private and no one can even see this. 

That aside;

sourcelist.py = sourceAPT.py and APTBatch.py = batchAPT.py

Both Ben_data_B and Ben_data_V are more than what the python file pumped out, esp Ben_data_B it has basically all the additional calculations like the pogsons law mag calcs. The headers are (hopefully) accurately written or atleast make sense as to what they contain, because for some reason the csv file once called into python and re opened, REMOVES all the formating of all cells including any formulae used and replaces it with the raw values. (Basically makes it look like I manually calculated and inputted the values instead of doing it once and dragging the fill box).
